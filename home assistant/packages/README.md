# `packages/`, to create helpers in seconds!
This dir contains a library of pre-set packages you can use to speed up the automation setup process.

### <u>**Usage example:**</u> 
I want to use the blueprint with my dishwasher, so I copy the entire `dishwasher` folder into the `packages/` directory on my Home Assistant.

Now my setup looks like this:
- `packages/`
  - `dishwasher/`
    - `asm_dishwasher.yaml`

Then, I proceed with the [second step of the configuration](../../README.md#-finalizing-the-configuration).
