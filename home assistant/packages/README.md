# `packages/`, to create helpers in seconds!
This dir contains a library of pre-set packages you can use to speed up the automation setup process. 

### <u>**Usage example:**</u> _I want to use the blueprint with my dishwasher, so I copy the entire `dishwasher` folder to the `packages/` directory on my Home Assistant._
Now my folder looks like this:
- `packages/`
  - `dishwasher/`
    - `asm_dishwasher.yaml`

Now I can proceed with the [second step of the configuration](../../README.md#ðŸ§°-finalizing-the-configuration).
