# How to use the `_ui_starter.yaml` files:

These files allow you to configure the blueprint in little to no time while preserving the **UI** editing feature.

To use them, please copy or make a new automation, go to `Edit in YAML` mode and paste  the content of one of these files.

To see your automation click here -> [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your automations.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/automations.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/automations/).

## **Do not** place these files inside the `packages/` folder.
