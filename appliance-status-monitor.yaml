blueprint:
  name: Monitor the state of an appliance - by leofabri
  description: >-
    `- Version: 3.0.0 -`


    This automation can detect and monitor the state of your appliances by observing their power consumption.

    This automation blueprint is universal and very versatile. You can use it with anything that consumes energy: a washing machine, a dishwasher, your fridge, the TV, etc. 
    I refer to the appliance's operations with the generic word job. A job could be anything (washing, rinsing...).


    You can pair this project with other automations and services. I designed it with flexibility in mind. For instance, if you want to 
    send alerts when the washing machine is not resuming a job, you want to send TTS notifications, or if 
    your fridge is somehow not working and de-icing you can see that happening. All you needed is just a little bit of creativity. 
    You can use the state machine and the custom actions to extend it.


    The state machine:

    * **<ins>unplugged</ins>** - The appliance is no longer powered. It happens when the user manually turns off the smart socket (from HA or the socket itself).

    * **<ins>idle</ins>** - There is no pending job, the machine is powered but idling.

    * **<ins>paused</ins>** - Indicates that a job is pending (incomplete cycle), but the appliance is not performing it. The inhibitors of these state are the ***detached_overload*** and ***unplugged*** states. In this condition the power consumption is lower than the finishing power threshold. The appliance must be off (maybe the user turned it off manually, or maybe the job needs some time to recover). The blueprint is waiting for the appliance to resume. **Pro Tip!** You could also use this to diagnose and warn if a job is not resumed after x minutes.

    * **<ins>detached_overload</ins>** - This happens when, during a cycle, the appliance used too much power and was suspended. It is also technically unplugged but we don't say that.

    * **<ins>job_ongoing</ins>** - Triggered in two cases:
      * when a new job cycle begins: the previous one is completed, and the Starting Power threshold is surpassed.
      * when a job is resumed.

    * **<ins>job_completed</ins>** - Triggered when the current incomplete job cycle is finished. The appliance consumes less than the Finishing Power threshold (with the possibility of selecting for how long)

        During a job cycle, some appliances may intermittently use more power than the starting power threshold, 
        thus entering the job_ongoing state (even when the job is not really started).

        With this value set, the automation will wait for the indicated time in seconds, and see if in that timespan the power consumption stays higher than the starting power threshold.

        This defines for how long the blueprint should "wait" before going from the job_completed -> idle state.
        Setting this to 0 will disable the waiting. This means that once the job has been done, if a new power reading is receives, the state will immediately transition to idle. 
        It could be minutes, or less than a second.

        This entity is in charge of triggering the execution of the automation when it changes from off -> on.

        Sometimes, if the power consumption of the appliance is perfectly steady, no other trigger will work, but this will.

        This variable allows the automation to call itself when some conditions are met.
