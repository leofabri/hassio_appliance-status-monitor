  name: Monitor the state of an appliance - by leofabri
  description: >-
    `- Version: 2.1.1 -`


    This automation can detect and monitor the state of your appliances by observing their power consumption.

    This automation blueprint is universal and very versatile. You can use it with anything that consumes energy: a washing machine, a dishwasher, your fridge, the TV, etc. 
    I refer to the appliance's operations with the generic word job. A job could be anything (washing, rinsing...).


    You can pair this project with other automations and services. I designed it with flexibility in mind. For instance, if you want to 
    send alerts when the washing machine is not resuming a job, you want to send TTS notifications, or if 
    your fridge is somehow not working and de-icing you can see that happening. All you needed is just a little bit of creativity. 
    You can use the state machine and the custom actions to extend it.


    The states of the state machine:

    * **<ins>unplugged</ins>** - The appliance is no longer powered. It happens when the user manually turns off the smart socket (from HA or the socket itself).

    * **<ins>idle</ins>** - There is no pending job, the machine is powered but idling.

    * **paused** - Indicates that a job is pending (incomplete cycle), but the appliance is not performing it. The inhibitors of these state are the ***datached_overload*** and ***unplugged*** states. In this condition the power consumption is lower than the finishing power threshold. The appliance must be off (maybe the user turned it off manually, or maybe the job needs some time to recover). The blueprint is waiting for the appliance to resume. **Pro Tip!** You could also use this to diagnose and warn if a job is not resumed after x minutes.

    * **<ins>detached_overload</ins>** - This happens when, during a cycle, the appliance used too much power and was suspended. It is also technically unplugged.

    * **<ins>job_ongoing</ins>** - Triggered in two cases:
      * when a new job cycle begins: the previous one is completed, and the Starting Power threshold is surpassed.
      * when a job is resumed.

    * **<ins>job_completed</ins>** - Triggered when the current incomplete job cycle is finished. The appliance consumes less than the Finishing Power threshold (with the possibility of selecting for how long)

        An input_number variable that turns into a value > 0 when an overload occurs. That would

        The State Machine entity of this appliance.

      selector:
        entity:
          domain: input_select
    appliance_job_cycle:

        A sensor that stores whether the appliance is still in a job cycle
        or not.<br>

        This has to be a boolean (so: 0 or 1).<br> <strong>off</strong> -> the appliance is
        not performing any job<br> <strong>on</strong> -> the job is incomplete.
        <br>

        <strong>Note that this entity does not provide any information about the detailed status
        of the machine (like an overload stuation). For that, you need the state machine.</strong>

        This entity is in charge of triggering the execution of the automation when it changes from off -> on.

        Sometimes, if the power consumption of the appliance is perfectly steady, no other trigger will work, but this will.

        This variable allows the automation to call itself when some conditions are met.
      default: []
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: input_boolean
    delayed_job_completion_duration:
      name: Delayed Job Completion duration
      description: >-
        (OPTIONAL | Helper | <i><strong>Suggested: 0, Default: 0 | DISABLED</strong></i>)


        During a job cycle, some appliances may intermittently absorb less than the finishing power threshold, 
        thus entering the job_completed state (even when not finished at all).

        Despite it being a rare occurrence, it might happen. 
        With this value set, the automation will wait for x seconds and see if in that timespan the power consumption rises.

        ...

        <strong>WARNING:</strong> Setting a duration introduces a delay on the transition to the 'job_completed' state.
        Please make sure that you need this, or leave it 0 if unsure.
      default: 0.0
      selector:
        number:
          min: 0.0
          max: 900.0

        Executed when the appliance starts a new job cycle (<strong>idle -> job_ongoing</strong>
        state).
        Note that here the job cycle indicator is off, which means that no previous job has to be completed.

        ...

        **WARNING:** Just use non-blocking actions in this space! No delays, actionable notifications, waits, or anything that could slow down the automation. 
        Please consider that the permanence in this state could last for a limited amount of time (seconds, potentially!). 
        This section is meant to be used to trigger other things.
